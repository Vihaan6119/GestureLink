Yes, TensorFlow can absolutely be used in Android Studio, and it's commonly used for deploying AI models in mobile apps. The typical approach is to use TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), which is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed specifically for mobile and embedded devices.

‚úÖ Options for Using TensorFlow in Android Studio
1. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)
This is the recommended approach for Android apps.

üîß Steps:
Train a model using TensorFlow (Python).

Convert the model to .tflite using TensorFlow Lite Converter.

Add the model to your Android Studio project.

Use the TFLite Interpreter API (Java/Kotlin) to run the model.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite

Optionally: tensorflow-lite-gpu or tensorflow-lite-support for image processing

üì∑ For Sign Language:
Use a CNN or custom model trained on sign language images.

Pair with MediaPipe Hands or a camera input pipeline to extract frames.

2. MediaPipe + TensorFlow Lite
For hand/keypoint detection + gesture recognition:

MediaPipe (by Google) gives you real-time hand tracking.

Combine it with a TFLite classifier to recognize sign gestures.

üß† Example Use Case
Workflow:

Use MediaPipe Hands to get hand landmarks.

Feed these landmarks into a TFLite model that classifies the sign.

Display the recognized sign in your app's UI.
